# Introduction

A place I come to to practice javascript.

## Destructing

I worked through examples from the youtube channel Web Dev Simplified to
learn how one destructures arrays & objects.

## Higher Order Functions

I worked through a tutorial by Brad Traversy to learn about higher order
functions in javascript like map and filter.
