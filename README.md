# Introduction

A place I come to to practice javascript.

## Destructing

I worked through examples from the youtube channel Web Dev Simplified to
learn how one destructures arrays & objects.

Destructuing is a technique to extract information from an object and
assign the extraction to a new variable.

## Higher Order Functions

I worked through a tutorial by Brad Traversy to learn about higher order
functions in javascript like map and filter.

map creates a new array where the original input array had an operation
preformed on all of it's member elements. For example, all elements in the
array where multiplied by 2.

filter creates a new array where the elements of the input array that did
not met a certain condition are filtered out. For example, all elements that
are less than 5 are not 'carried over' to the new array.

reduce allows returns a single value from an input array after applying a
reducer function on the input array.
